# Utils Scripts

Just two simple scripts I made several years ago that I use for renaming class name file (when finally I found the filename is too long or doesn't match with the convention's project). The other one (change_php_key) I use for updating the year in the copyright header (especially on my big projects such as [https://github.com/pH7Software/pH7-Social-Dating-CMS](pH7CMS)).

I finally decided myself to publish it on Github so everybody can enjoy it :smiley:
